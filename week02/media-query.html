            <h2>Jacob 7:26</h2>
            <p>And it came to pass that I, Jacob, began to be old; and the record of this people being kept on the other plates of
            Nephi, wherefore, I conclude this record, declaring that I have written according to the best of my knowledge, by saying
            that the time passed away with us, and also our lives passed away like as it were unto us a dream, we being a lonesome
            and a solemn people, wanderers, cast out from Jerusalem, born in tribulation, in a wilderness, and hated of our
            brethren, which caused wars and contentions; wherefore, we did mourn out our days.</p>

            <h2>1 Nephi 4:13</h2>
            <p>Behold the Lord slayeth the wicked to bring forth his righteous purposes. It is better that one man should perish than
            that a nation should dwindle and perish in unbelief.</p>
